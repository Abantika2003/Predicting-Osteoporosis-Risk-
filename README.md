# 🦴 Predicting Osteoporosis Risk Using Machine Learning

## 📖 About The Project
Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease that weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures.  
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the risk of osteoporosis using patient health data.  
The goal is to support early diagnosis and enable preventive healthcare strategies.
